  # A beaoooootifol hack to add a Sinatra::Reloader to any and all sinatra-apps
  # created in this environment. It works by hooking the inherited-event on the
  # Sinatra::Base class as the reloader has to be registerd before any routes
  # are added.
  # This hack is triggered whenever the sinatra-contrib-gem is part of the bundle.
